Design Description:

The designed shopping cart application is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism. It consists of an abstract base class, Item, and three derived classes representing different types of items: MusicCD, Book, and Magazine. These classes model various types of products that can be added to the shopping cart. The ShoppingCart class manages a collection of items and provides methods to add items, display contents, and summarize the cart.

Assumptions:

The application is assumed to run on a system with a modern C++ compiler.
It is assumed that the shopping cart will only contain the three types of items mentioned in the problem statement (Music CDs, Books, and Magazines).
Strengths:

The code adheres to modern C++ best practices, making it more readable and maintainable.
The use of inheritance and polymorphism allows for easy extension of the item types and their behavior.
The use of std::unique_ptr for item storage ensures proper memory management.
The implementation is modular, allowing for simple updates and modifications.
Weaknesses:

The current design does not include error handling for exceptional situations, such as file I/O errors.
The application only supports a simple text output format for displaying cart contents.
Possible improvements:

Implement error handling to address potential issues with file I/O, memory allocation, and other exceptional situations.
Extend the application to support additional item types and properties, such as item quantity, discounts, or promotions.
Add support for more advanced output formats, such as HTML, JSON, or XML, to improve the user experience.
Implement a more comprehensive user interface to facilitate interaction with the application.
Incorporate unit testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
By following modern C++ best practices and providing a clean, modular design, this implementation demonstrates my ability to contribute effectively as a member of a small development team. The code is designed to be easily understood and maintained by others, and the suggested improvements show a forward-thinking approach to application development.

Furthermore, the code should be split into separate cpp and hpp files for better organization; implementation and definitions should be separate.

Additionally, templates and the use of generics might address another issue, which is redundancy among the item types.
